<h1>AN ESSAY ON COMEDY AND THE USES OF THE COMIC SPIRIT<br />
by George Meredith</h1>

<h2>ON THE IDEA OF COMEDY AND OF THE USES OF THE COMIC SPIRIT <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></h2>
<p>Good Comedies are such rare productions, that notwithstanding the
wealth of our literature in the Comic element, it would not occupy us
long to run over the English list.&nbsp; If they are brought to the
test I shall propose, very reputable Comedies will be found unworthy
of their station, like the ladies of Arthur&rsquo;s Court when they
were reduced to the ordeal of the mantle.</p>
<p>There are plain reasons why the Comic poet is not a frequent apparition;
and why the great Comic poet remains without a fellow.&nbsp; A society
of cultivated men and women is required, wherein ideas are current and
the perceptions quick, that he may be supplied with matter and an audience.&nbsp;
The semi-barbarism of merely giddy communities, and feverish emotional
periods, repel him; and also a state of marked social inequality of
the sexes; nor can he whose business is to address the mind be understood
where there is not a moderate degree of intellectual activity.</p>
<p>Moreover, to touch and kindle the mind through laughter, demands
more than sprightliness, a most subtle delicacy.&nbsp; That must be
a natal gift in the Comic poet.&nbsp; The substance he deals with will
show him a startling exhibition of the dyer&rsquo;s hand, if he is without
it.&nbsp; People are ready to surrender themselves to witty thumps on
the back, breast, and sides; all except the head: and it is there that
he aims.&nbsp; He must be subtle to penetrate.&nbsp; A corresponding
acuteness must exist to welcome him.&nbsp; The necessity for the two
conditions will explain how it is that we count him during centuries
in the singular number.</p>
<p>&lsquo;C&rsquo;est une &eacute;trange entreprise que celle de faire
rire les honn&ecirc;tes gens,&rsquo; Moli&egrave;re says; and the difficulty
of the undertaking cannot be over-estimated.</p>
<p>Then again, he is beset with foes to right and left, of a character
unknown to the tragic and the lyric poet, or even to philosophers.</p>
<p>We have in this world men whom Rabelais would call agelasts; that
is to say, non-laughers; men who are in that respect as dead bodies,
which if you prick them do not bleed.&nbsp; The old grey boulder-stone
that has finished its peregrination from the rock to the valley, is
as easily to be set rolling up again as these men laughing.&nbsp; No
collision of circumstances in our mortal career strikes a light for
them.&nbsp; It is but one step from being agelastic to misogelastic,
and the &mu;&iota;&sigma;&omicron;y&epsilon;&lambda;&omega;&sigmaf;,
the laughter-hating, soon learns to dignify his dislike as an objection
in morality.</p>
<p>We have another class of men, who are pleased to consider themselves
antagonists of the foregoing, and whom we may term hypergelasts; the
excessive laughers, ever-laughing, who are as clappers of a bell, that
may be rung by a breeze, a grimace; who are so loosely put together
that a wink will shake them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;. . . C&rsquo;est n&rsquo;estimer rien qu&rsquo;estioner
tout le monde,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to laugh at everything is to have no appreciation of the Comic
of Comedy.</p>
<p>Neither of these distinct divisions of non-laughers and over-laughers
would be entertained by reading The Rape of the Lock, or seeing a performance
of Le Tartuffe.&nbsp; In relation to the stage, they have taken in our
land the form and title of Puritan and Bacchanalian.&nbsp; For though
the stage is no longer a public offender, and Shakespeare has been revived
on it, to give it nobility, we have not yet entirely raised it above
the contention of these two parties.&nbsp; Our speaking on the theme
of Comedy will appear almost a libertine proceeding to one, while the
other will think that the speaking of it seriously brings us into violent
contrast with the subject.</p>
<p>Comedy, we have to admit, was never one of the most honoured of the
Muses.&nbsp; She was in her origin, short of slaughter, the loudest
expression of the little civilization of men.&nbsp; The light of Athene
over the head of Achilles illuminates the birth of Greek Tragedy.&nbsp;
But Comedy rolled in shouting under the divine protection of the Son
of the Wine-jar, as Dionysus is made to proclaim himself by Aristophanes.&nbsp;
Our second Charles was the patron, of like benignity, of our Comedy
of Manners, which began similarly as a combative performance, under
a licence to deride and outrage the Puritan, and was here and there
Bacchanalian beyond the Aristophanic example: worse, inasmuch as a cynical
licentiousness is more abominable than frank filth.&nbsp; An eminent
Frenchman judges from the quality of some of the stuff dredged up for
the laughter of men and women who sat through an Athenian Comic play,
that they could have had small delicacy in other affairs when they had
so little in their choice of entertainment.&nbsp; Perhaps he does not
make sufficient allowance for the regulated licence of plain speaking
proper to the festival of the god, and claimed by the Comic poet as
his inalienable right, or for the fact that it was a festival in a season
of licence, in a city accustomed to give ear to the boldest utterance
of both sides of a case.&nbsp; However that may be, there can be no
question that the men and women who sat through the acting of Wycherley&rsquo;s
Country Wife were past blushing.&nbsp; Our tenacity of national impressions
has caused the word theatre since then to prod the Puritan nervous system
like a satanic instrument; just as one has known Anti-Papists, for whom
Smithfield was redolent of a sinister smoke, as though they had a later
recollection of the place than the lowing herds.&nbsp; Hereditary Puritanism,
regarding the stage, is met, to this day, in many families quite undistinguished
by arrogant piety.&nbsp; It has subsided altogether as a power in the
profession of morality; but it is an error to suppose it extinct, and
unjust also to forget that it had once good reason to hate, shun, and
rebuke our public shows.</p>
<p>We shall find ourselves about where the Comic spirit would place
us, if we stand at middle distance between the inveterate opponents
and the drum-and-fife supporters of Comedy: &lsquo;Comme un point fixe
fait remarquer l&rsquo;emportement des autres,&rsquo; as Pascal says.&nbsp;
And were there more in this position, Comic genius would flourish.</p>
<p>Our English idea of a Comedy of Manners might be imaged in the person
of a blowsy country girl&mdash;say Hoyden, the daughter of Sir Tunbelly
Clumsy, who, when at home, &lsquo;never disobeyed her father except
in the eating of green gooseberries&rsquo;&mdash;transforming to a varnished
City madam; with a loud laugh and a mincing step; the crazy ancestress
of an accountably fallen descendant.&nbsp; She bustles prodigiously
and is punctually smart in her speech, always in a fluster to escape
from Dulness, as they say the dogs on the Nile-banks drink at the river
running to avoid the crocodile.&nbsp; If the monster catches her, as
at times he does, she whips him to a froth, so that those who know Dulness
only as a thing of ponderousness, shall fail to recognise him in that
light and airy shape.</p>
<p>When she has frolicked through her five Acts to surprise you with
the information that Mr. Aimwell is converted by a sudden death in the
world outside the scenes into Lord Aimwell, and can marry the lady in
the light of day, it is to the credit of her vivacious nature that she
does not anticipate your calling her Farce.&nbsp; Five is dignity with
a trailing robe; whereas one, two, or three Acts would be short skirts,
and degrading.&nbsp; Advice has been given to householders, that they
should follow up the shot at a burglar in the dark by hurling the pistol
after it, so that if the bullet misses, the weapon may strike and assure
the rascal he has it.&nbsp; The point of her wit is in this fashion
supplemented by the rattle of her tongue, and effectively, according
to the testimony of her admirers.&nbsp; Her wit is at once, like steam
in an engine, the motive force and the warning whistle of her headlong
course; and it vanishes like the track of steam when she has reached
her terminus, never troubling the brains afterwards; a merit that it
shares with good wine, to the joy of the Bacchanalians.&nbsp; As to
this wit, it is warlike.&nbsp; In the neatest hands it is like the sword
of the cavalier in the Mall, quick to flash out upon slight provocation,
and for a similar office&mdash;to wound.&nbsp; Commonly its attitude
is entirely pugilistic; two blunt fists rallying and countering.&nbsp;
When harmless, as when the word &lsquo;fool&rsquo; occurs, or allusions
to the state of husband, it has the sound of the smack of harlequin&rsquo;s
wand upon clown, and is to the same extent exhilarating.&nbsp; Believe
that idle empty laughter is the most desirable of recreations, and significant
Comedy will seem pale and shallow in comparison.&nbsp; Our popular idea
would be hit by the sculptured group of Laughter holding both his sides,
while Comedy pummels, by way of tickling him.&nbsp; As to a meaning,
she holds that it does not conduce to making merry: you might as well
carry cannon on a racing-yacht.&nbsp; Morality is a duenna to be circumvented.&nbsp;
This was the view of English Comedy of a sagacious essayist, who said
that the end of a Comedy would often be the commencement of a Tragedy,
were the curtain to rise again on the performers.&nbsp; In those old
days female modesty was protected by a fan, behind which, and it was
of a convenient semicircular breadth, the ladies present in the theatre
retired at a signal of decorum, to peep, covertly askant, or with the
option of so peeping, through a prettily fringed eyelet-hole in the
eclipsing arch.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ego limis specto sic per flabellum clanculum.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>TERENCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That fan is the flag and symbol of the society giving us our so-called
Comedy of Manners, or Comedy of the manners of South-sea Islanders under
city veneer; and as to Comic idea, vacuous as the mask without the face
behind it.</p>
<p>Elia, whose humour delighted in floating a galleon paradox and wafting
it as far as it would go, bewails the extinction of our artificial Comedy,
like a poet sighing over the vanished splendour of Cleopatra&rsquo;s
Nile-barge; and the sedateness of his plea for a cause condemned even
in his time to the penitentiary, is a novel effect of the ludicrous.&nbsp;
When the realism of those &lsquo;fictitious half-believed personages,&rsquo;
as he calls them, had ceased to strike, they were objectionable company,
uncaressable as puppets.&nbsp; Their artifices are staringly naked,
and have now the effect of a painted face viewed, after warm hours of
dancing, in the morning light.&nbsp; How could the Lurewells and the
Plyants ever have been praised for ingenuity in wickedness?&nbsp; Critics,
apparently sober, and of high reputation, held up their shallow knaveries
for the world to admire.&nbsp; These Lurewells, Plyants, Pinchwifes,
Fondlewifes, Miss Prue, Peggy, Hoyden, all of them save charming Milamant,
are dead as last year&rsquo;s clothes in a fashionable fine lady&rsquo;s
wardrobe, and it must be an exceptionably abandoned Abigail of our period
that would look on them with the wish to appear in their likeness.&nbsp;
Whether the puppet show of Punch and Judy inspires our street-urchins
to have instant recourse to their fists in a dispute, after the fashion
of every one of the actors in that public entertainment who gets possession
of the cudgel, is open to question: it has been hinted; and angry moralists
have traced the national taste for tales of crime to the smell of blood
in our nursery-songs.&nbsp; It will at any rate hardly be questioned
that it is unwholesome for men and women to see themselves as they are,
if they are no better than they should be: and they will not, when they
have improved in manners, care much to see themselves as they once were.&nbsp;
That comes of realism in the Comic art; and it is not public caprice,
but the consequence of a bettering state. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
The same of an immoral may be said of realistic exhibitions of a vulgar
society.</p>
<p>The French make a critical distinction in <i>ce qui remue</i> from
<i>ce qui &eacute;meut</i>&mdash;that which agitates from that which
touches with emotion.&nbsp; In the realistic comedy it is an incessant
<i>remuage</i>&mdash;no calm, merely bustling figures, and no thought.&nbsp;
Excepting Congreve&rsquo;s Way of the World, which failed on the stage,
there was nothing to keep our comedy alive on its merits; neither, with
all its realism, true portraiture, nor much quotable fun, nor idea;
neither salt nor soul.</p>
<p>The French have a school of stately comedy to which they can fly
for renovation whenever they have fallen away from it; and their having
such a school is mainly the reason why, as John Stuart Mill pointed
out, they know men and women more accurately than we do.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re
followed the Horatian precept, to observe the manners of his age and
give his characters the colour befitting them at the time.&nbsp; He
did not paint in raw realism.&nbsp; He seized his characters firmly
for the central purpose of the play, stamped them in the idea, and by
slightly raising and softening the object of study (as in the case of
the ex-Huguenot, Duke de Montausier, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>
for the study of the Misanthrope, and, according to St. Simon, the Abbe
Roquette for Tartuffe), generalized upon it so as to make it permanently
human.&nbsp; Concede that it is natural for human creatures to live
in society, and Alceste is an imperishable mark of one, though he is
drawn in light outline, without any forcible human colouring.&nbsp;
Our English school has not clearly imagined society; and of the mind
hovering above congregated men and women, it has imagined nothing.&nbsp;
The critics who praise it for its downrightness, and for bringing the
situations home to us, as they admiringly say, cannot but disapprove
of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s comedy, which appeals to the individual mind
to perceive and participate in the social.&nbsp; We have splendid tragedies,
we have the most beautiful of poetic plays, and we have literary comedies
passingly pleasant to read, and occasionally to see acted.&nbsp; By
literary comedies, I mean comedies of classic inspiration, drawn chiefly
from Menander and the Greek New Comedy through Terence; or else comedies
of the poet&rsquo;s personal conception, that have had no model in life,
and are humorous exaggerations, happy or otherwise.&nbsp; These are
the comedies of Ben Jonson, Massinger, and Fletcher.&nbsp; Massinger&rsquo;s
Justice Greedy we can all of us refer to a type, &lsquo;with fat capon
lined&rsquo; that has been and will be; and he would be comic, as Panurge
is comic, but only a Rabelais could set him moving with real animation.&nbsp;
Probably Justice Greedy would be comic to the audience of a country
booth and to some of our friends.&nbsp; If we have lost our youthful
relish for the presentation of characters put together to fit a type,
we find it hard to put together the mechanism of a civil smile at his
enumeration of his dishes.&nbsp; Something of the same is to be said
of Bobadil, swearing &lsquo;by the foot of Pharaoh&rsquo;; with a reservation,
for he is made to move faster, and to act.&nbsp; The comic of Jonson
is a scholar&rsquo;s excogitation of the comic; that of Massinger a
moralist&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Shakespeare is a well-spring of characters which are saturated with
the comic spirit; with more of what we will call blood-life than is
to be found anywhere out of Shakespeare; and they are of this world,
but they are of the world enlarged to our embrace by imagination, and
by great poetic imagination.&nbsp; They are, as it were&mdash;I put
it to suit my present comparison&mdash;creatures of the woods and wilds,
not in walled towns, not grouped and toned to pursue a comic exhibition
of the narrower world of society.&nbsp; Jaques, Falstaff and his regiment,
the varied troop of Clowns, Malvolio, Sir Hugh Evans and Fluellen&mdash;marvellous
Welshmen!&mdash;Benedict and Beatrice, Dogberry, and the rest, are subjects
of a special study in the poetically comic.</p>
<p>His Comedy of incredible imbroglio belongs to the literary section.&nbsp;
One may conceive that there was a natural resemblance between him and
Menander, both in the scheme and style of his lighter plays.&nbsp; Had
Shakespeare lived in a later and less emotional, less heroical period
of our history, he might have turned to the painting of manners as well
as humanity.&nbsp; Euripides would probably, in the time of Menander,
when Athens was enslaved but prosperous, have lent his hand to the composition
of romantic comedy.&nbsp; He certainly inspired that fine genius.</p>
<p>Politically it is accounted a misfortune for France that her nobles
thronged to the Court of Louis Quatorze.&nbsp; It was a boon to the
comic poet.&nbsp; He had that lively quicksilver world of the animalcule
passions, the huge pretensions, the placid absurdities, under his eyes
in full activity; vociferous quacks and snapping dupes, hypocrites,
posturers, extravagants, pedants, rose-pink ladies and mad grammarians,
sonneteering marquises, high-flying mistresses, plain-minded maids,
inter-threading as in a loom, noisy as at a fair.&nbsp; A simply bourgeois
circle will not furnish it, for the middle class must have the brilliant,
flippant, independent upper for a spur and a pattern; otherwise it is
likely to be inwardly dull as well as outwardly correct.&nbsp; Yet,
though the King was benevolent toward Moli&egrave;re, it is not to the
French Court that we are indebted for his unrivalled studies of mankind
in society.&nbsp; For the amusement of the Court the ballets and farces
were written, which are dearer to the rabble upper, as to the rabble
lower, class than intellectual comedy.&nbsp; The French bourgeoisie
of Paris were sufficiently quick-witted and enlightened by education
to welcome great works like Le Tartuffe, Les Femmes Savantes, and Le
Misanthrope, works that were perilous ventures on the popular intelligence,
big vessels to launch on streams running to shallows.&nbsp; The Tartuffe
hove into view as an enemy&rsquo;s vessel; it offended, not <i>Dieu
mais les d&eacute;vots</i>, as the Prince de Cond&eacute; explained
the cabal raised against it to the King.</p>
<p>The Femmes Savantes is a capital instance of the uses of comedy in
teaching the world to understand what ails it.&nbsp; The farce of the
Pr&eacute;cieuses ridiculed and put a stop to the monstrous romantic
jargon made popular by certain famous novels.&nbsp; The comedy of the
Femmes Savantes exposed the later and less apparent but more finely
comic absurdity of an excessive purism in grammar and diction, and the
tendency to be idiotic in precision.&nbsp; The French had felt the burden
of this new nonsense; but they had to see the comedy several times before
they were consoled in their suffering by seeing the cause of it exposed.</p>
<p>The Misanthrope was yet more frigidly received.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re
thought it dead.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot improve on it, and assuredly
never shall,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; It is one of the French titles to
honour that this quintessential comedy of the opposition of Alceste
and C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne was ultimately understood and applauded.&nbsp;
In all countries the middle class presents the public which, fighting
the world, and with a good footing in the fight, knows the world best.&nbsp;
It may be the most selfish, but that is a question leading us into sophistries.&nbsp;
Cultivated men and women, who do not skim the cream of life, and are
attached to the duties, yet escape the harsher blows, make acute and
balanced observers.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re is their poet.</p>
<p>Of this class in England, a large body, neither Puritan nor Bacchanalian,
have a sentimental objection to face the study of the actual world.&nbsp;
They take up disdain of it, when its truths appear humiliating: when
the facts are not immediately forced on them, they take up the pride
of incredulity.&nbsp; They live in a hazy atmosphere that they suppose
an ideal one.&nbsp; Humorous writing they will endure, perhaps approve,
if it mingles with pathos to shake and elevate the feelings.&nbsp; They
approve of Satire, because, like the beak of the vulture, it smells
of carrion, which they are not.&nbsp; But of Comedy they have a shivering
dread, for Comedy enfolds them with the wretched host of the world,
huddles them with us all in an ignoble assimilation, and cannot be used
by any exalted variety as a scourge and a broom.&nbsp; Nay, to be an
exalted variety is to come under the calm curious eye of the Comic spirit,
and be probed for what you are.&nbsp; Men are seen among them, and very
many cultivated women.&nbsp; You may distinguish them by a favourite
phrase: &lsquo;Surely we are not so bad!&rsquo; and the remark: &lsquo;If
that is human nature, save us from it!&rsquo; as if it could be done:
but in the peculiar Paradise of the wilful people who will not see,
the exclamation assumes the saving grace.</p>
<p>Yet should you ask them whether they dislike sound sense, they vow
they do not.&nbsp; And question cultivated women whether it pleases
them to be shown moving on an intellectual level with men, they will
answer that it does; numbers of them claim the situation.&nbsp; Now,
Comedy is the fountain of sound sense; not the less perfectly sound
on account of the sparkle: and Comedy lifts women to a station offering
them free play for their wit, as they usually show it, when they have
it, on the side of sound sense.&nbsp; The higher the Comedy, the more
prominent the part they enjoy in it.&nbsp; Dorine in the Tartuffe is
common-sense incarnate, though palpably a waiting-maid.&nbsp; C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne
is undisputed mistress of the same attribute in the Misanthrope; wiser
as a woman than Alceste as man.&nbsp; In Congreve&rsquo;s Way of the
World, Millamant overshadows Mirabel, the sprightliest male figure of
English comedy.</p>
<p>But those two ravishing women, so copious and so choice of speech,
who fence with men and pass their guard, are heartless!&nbsp; Is it
not preferable to be the pretty idiot, the passive beauty, the adorable
bundle of caprices, very feminine, very sympathetic, of romantic and
sentimental fiction?&nbsp; Our women are taught to think so.&nbsp; The
Agn&egrave;s of the &Eacute;cole des Femmes should be a lesson for men.&nbsp;
The heroines of Comedy are like women of the world, not necessarily
heartless from being clear-sighted: they seem so to the sentimentally-reared
only for the reason that they use their wits, and are not wandering
vessels crying for a captain or a pilot.&nbsp; Comedy is an exhibition
of their battle with men, and that of men with them: and as the two,
however divergent, both look on one object, namely, Life, the gradual
similarity of their impressions must bring them to some resemblance.&nbsp;
The Comic poet dares to show us men and women coming to this mutual
likeness; he is for saying that when they draw together in social life
their minds grow liker; just as the philosopher discerns the similarity
of boy and girl, until the girl is marched away to the nursery.&nbsp;
Philosopher and Comic poet are of a cousinship in the eye they cast
on life: and they are equally unpopular with our wilful English of the
hazy region and the ideal that is not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Thus, for want of instruction in the Comic idea, we lose a large
audience among our cultivated middle class that we should expect to
support Comedy.&nbsp; The sentimentalist is as averse as the Puritan
and as the Bacchanalian.</p>
<p>Our traditions are unfortunate.&nbsp; The public taste is with the
idle laughers, and still inclines to follow them.&nbsp; It may be shown
by an analysis of Wycherley&rsquo;s Plain Dealer, a coarse prose adaption
of the Misanthrope, stuffed with lumps of realism in a vulgarized theme
to hit the mark of English appetite, that we have in it the keynote
of the Comedy of our stage.&nbsp; It is Moli&egrave;re travestied, with
the hoof to his foot and hair on the pointed tip of his ear.&nbsp; And
how difficult it is for writers to disentangle themselves from bad traditions
is noticeable when we find Goldsmith, who had grave command of the Comic
in narrative, producing an elegant farce for a Comedy; and Fielding,
who was a master of the Comic both in narrative and in dialogue, not
even approaching to the presentable in farce.</p>
<p>These bad traditions of Comedy affect us not only on the stage, but
in our literature, and may be tracked into our social life.&nbsp; They
are the ground of the heavy moralizings by which we are outwearied,
about Life as a Comedy, and Comedy as a jade, <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>
when popular writers, conscious of fatigue in creativeness, desire to
be cogent in a modish cynicism: perversions of the idea of life, and
of the proper esteem for the society we have wrested from brutishness,
and would carry higher.&nbsp; Stock images of this description are accepted
by the timid and the sensitive, as well as by the saturnine, quite seriously;
for not many look abroad with their own eyes, fewer still have the habit
of thinking for themselves.&nbsp; Life, we know too well, is not a Comedy,
but something strangely mixed; nor is Comedy a vile mask.&nbsp; The
corrupted importation from France was noxious; a noble entertainment
spoilt to suit the wretched taste of a villanous age; and the later
imitations of it, partly drained of its poison and made decorous, became
tiresome, notwithstanding their fun, in the perpetual recurring of the
same situations, owing to the absence of original study and vigour of
conception.&nbsp; Scene v. Act 2 of the Misanthrope, owing, no doubt,
to the fact of our not producing matter for original study, is repeated
in succession by Wycherley, Congreve, and Sheridan, and as it is at
second hand, we have it done cynically&mdash;or such is the tone; in
the manner of &lsquo;below stairs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Comedy thus treated
may be accepted as a version of the ordinary worldly understanding of
our social life; at least, in accord with the current dicta concerning
it.&nbsp; The epigrams can be made; but it is uninstructive, rather
tending to do disservice.&nbsp; Comedy justly treated, as you find it
in Moli&egrave;re, whom we so clownishly mishandled, the Comedy of Moli&egrave;re
throws no infamous reflection upon life.&nbsp; It is deeply conceived,
in the first place, and therefore it cannot be impure.&nbsp; Meditate
on that statement.&nbsp; Never did man wield so shrieking a scourge
upon vice, but his consummate self-mastery is not shaken while administering
it.&nbsp; Tartuffe and Harpagon, in fact, are made each to whip himself
and his class, the false pietists, and the insanely covetous.&nbsp;
Moli&egrave;re has only set them in motion.&nbsp; He strips Folly to
the skin, displays the imposture of the creature, and is content to
offer her better clothing, with the lesson Chrysale reads to Philaminte
and B&eacute;lise.&nbsp; He conceives purely, and he writes purely,
in the simplest language, the simplest of French verse.&nbsp; The source
of his wit is clear reason: it is a fountain of that soil; and it springs
to vindicate reason, common-sense, rightness and justice; for no vain
purpose ever.&nbsp; The wit is of such pervading spirit that it inspires
a pun with meaning and interest. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
His moral does not hang like a tail, or preach from one character incessantly
cocking an eye at the audience, as in recent realistic French Plays:
but is in the heart of his work, throbbing with every pulsation of an
organic structure.&nbsp; If Life is likened to the comedy of Moli&egrave;re,
there is no scandal in the comparison.</p>
<p>Congreve&rsquo;s Way of the World is an exception to our other comedies,
his own among them, by virtue of the remarkable brilliancy of the writing,
and the figure of Millamant.&nbsp; The comedy has no idea in it, beyond
the stale one, that so the world goes; and it concludes with the jaded
discovery of a document at a convenient season for the descent of the
curtain.&nbsp; A plot was an afterthought with Congreve.&nbsp; By the
help of a wooden villain (Maskwell) marked Gallows to the flattest eye,
he gets a sort of plot in The Double Dealer. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a>&nbsp;
His Way of the World might be called The Conquest of a Town Coquette,
and Millamant is a perfect portrait of a coquette, both in her resistance
to Mirabel and the manner of her surrender, and also in her tongue.&nbsp;
The wit here is not so salient as in certain passages of Love for Love,
where Valentine feigns madness or retorts on his father, or Mrs. Frail
rejoices in the harmlessness of wounds to a woman&rsquo;s virtue, if
she &lsquo;keeps them from air.&rsquo;&nbsp; In The Way of the World,
it appears less prepared in the smartness, and is more diffused in the
more characteristic style of the speakers.&nbsp; Here, however, as elsewhere,
his famous wit is like a bully-fencer, not ashamed to lay traps for
its exhibition, transparently petulant for the train between certain
ordinary words and the powder-magazine of the improprieties to be fired.&nbsp;
Contrast the wit of Congreve with Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That
of the first is a Toledo blade, sharp, and wonderfully supple for steel;
cast for duelling, restless in the scabbard, being so pretty when out
of it.&nbsp; To shine, it must have an adversary.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
wit is like a running brook, with innumerable fresh lights on it at
every turn of the wood through which its business is to find a way.&nbsp;
It does not run in search of obstructions, to be noisy over them; but
when dead leaves and viler substances are heaped along the course, its
natural song is heightened.&nbsp; Without effort, and with no dazzling
flashes of achievement, it is full of healing, the wit of good breeding,
the wit of wisdom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Genuine humour and true wit,&rsquo; says Landor, <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a>
&lsquo;require a sound and capacious mind, which is always a grave one.&nbsp;
Rabelais and La Fontaine are recorded by their countrymen to have been
<i>r&ecirc;veurs</i>.&nbsp; Few men have been graver than Pascal.&nbsp;
Few men have been wittier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To apply the citation of so great a brain as Pascal&rsquo;s to our
countryman would be unfair.&nbsp; Congreve had a certain soundness of
mind; of capacity, in the sense intended by Landor, he had little.&nbsp;
Judging him by his wit, he performed some happy thrusts, and taking
it for genuine, it is a surface wit, neither rising from a depth nor
flowing from a spring.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On voit qu&rsquo;il se travaille &agrave; dire
de bons mots.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He drives the poor hack word, &lsquo;fool,&rsquo; as cruelly to the
market for wit as any of his competitors.&nbsp; Here is an example,
that has been held up for eulogy:</p>
<blockquote><p>WITWOUD: He has brought me a letter from the fool my
brother, etc. etc.</p>
<p>MIRABEL: A fool, and your brother, Witwoud?</p>
<p>WITWOUD: Ay, ay, my half-brother.&nbsp; My half-brother he is; no
nearer, upon my honour.</p>
<p>MIRABEL: Then &rsquo;tis possible he may be but half a fool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By evident preparation.&nbsp; This is a sort of wit one remembers
to have heard at school, of a brilliant outsider; perhaps to have been
guilty of oneself, a trifle later.&nbsp; It was, no doubt, a blaze of
intellectual fireworks to the bumpkin squire, who came to London to
go to the theatre and learn manners.</p>
<p>Where Congreve excels all his English rivals is in his literary force,
and a succinctness of style peculiar to him.&nbsp; He had correct judgement,
a correct ear, readiness of illustration within a narrow range, in snapshots
of the obvious at the obvious, and copious language.&nbsp; He hits the
mean of a fine style and a natural in dialogue.&nbsp; He is at once
precise and voluble.&nbsp; If you have ever thought upon style you will
acknowledge it to be a signal accomplishment.&nbsp; In this he is a
classic, and is worthy of treading a measure with Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
The Way of the World may be read out currently at a first glance, so
sure are the accents of the emphatic meaning to strike the eye, perforce
of the crispness and cunning polish of the sentences.&nbsp; You have
not to look over them before you confide yourself to him; he will carry
you safe.&nbsp; Sheridan imitated, but was far from surpassing him.&nbsp;
The flow of boudoir Billingsgate in Lady Wishfort is unmatched for the
vigour and pointedness of the tongue.&nbsp; It spins along with a final
ring, like the voice of Nature in a fury, and is, indeed, racy eloquence
of the elevated fishwife.</p>
<p>Millamant is an admirable, almost a lovable heroine.&nbsp; It is
a piece of genius in a writer to make a woman&rsquo;s manner of speech
portray her.&nbsp; You feel sensible of her presence in every line of
her speaking.&nbsp; The stipulations with her lover in view of marriage,
her fine lady&rsquo;s delicacy, and fine lady&rsquo;s easy evasions
of indelicacy, coquettish airs, and playing with irresolution, which
in a common maid would be bashfulness, until she submits to &lsquo;dwindle
into a wife,&rsquo; as she says, form a picture that lives in the frame,
and is in harmony with Mirabel&rsquo;s description of her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Here she comes, i&rsquo; faith, full sail, with
her fan spread, and her streamers out, and a shoal of fools for tenders.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, after an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Think of you!&nbsp; To think of a whirlwind, though
&rsquo;twere in a whirlwind, were a case of more steady contemplation,
a very tranquillity of mind and mansion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a picturesqueness, as of Millamant and no other, in her
voice, when she is encouraged to take Mirabel by Mrs. Fainall, who is
&lsquo;sure she has a mind to him&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>MILLAMANT: Are you?&nbsp; I think I have&mdash;and the
horrid man looks as if he thought so too, etc. etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One hears the tones, and sees the sketch and colour of the whole
scene in reading it.</p>
<p>C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne is behind Millamant in vividness.&nbsp; An
air of bewitching whimsicality hovers over the graces of this Comic
heroine, like the lively conversational play of a beautiful mouth.</p>
<p>But in wit she is no rival of C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne.&nbsp; What
she utters adds to her personal witchery, and is not further memorable.&nbsp;
She is a flashing portrait, and a type of the superior ladies who do
not think, not of those who do.&nbsp; In representing a class, therefore,
it is a lower class, in the proportion that one of Gainsborough&rsquo;s
full-length aristocratic women is below the permanent impressiveness
of a fair Venetian head.</p>
<p>Millamant side by side with C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne is an example
of how far the realistic painting of a character can be carried to win
our favour; and of where it falls short.&nbsp; C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne
is a woman&rsquo;s mind in movement, armed with an ungovernable wit;
with perspicacious clear eyes for the world, and a very distinct knowledge
that she belongs to the world, and is most at home in it.&nbsp; She
is attracted to Alceste by her esteem for his honesty; she cannot avoid
seeing where the good sense of the man is diseased.</p>
<p>Rousseau, in his letter to D&rsquo;Alembert on the subject of the
Misanthrope, discusses the character of Alceste, as though Moli&egrave;re
had put him forth for an absolute example of misanthropy; whereas Alceste
is only a misanthrope of the circle he finds himself placed in: he has
a touching faith in the virtue residing in the country, and a critical
love of sweet simpleness.&nbsp; Nor is he the principal person of the
comedy to which he gives a name.&nbsp; He is only passively comic.&nbsp;
C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne is the active spirit.&nbsp; While he is denouncing
and railing, the trial is imposed upon her to make the best of him,
and control herself, as much as a witty woman, eagerly courted, can
do.&nbsp; By appreciating him she practically confesses her faultiness,
and she is better disposed to meet him half-way than he is to bend an
inch: only she is <i>une &acirc;me de vingt ans</i>, the world is pleasant,
and if the gilded flies of the Court are silly, uncompromising fanatics
have their ridiculous features as well.&nbsp; Can she abandon the life
they make agreeable to her, for a man who will not be guided by the
common sense of his class; and who insists on plunging into one extreme&mdash;equal
to suicide in her eyes&mdash;to avoid another?&nbsp; That is the comic
question of the Misanthrope.&nbsp; Why will he not continue to mix with
the world smoothly, appeased by the flattery of her secret and really
sincere preference of him, and taking his revenge in satire of it, as
she does from her own not very lofty standard, and will by and by do
from his more exalted one?</p>
<p>C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne is worldliness: Alceste is unworldliness.&nbsp;
It does not quite imply unselfishness; and that is perceived by her
shrewd head.&nbsp; Still he is a very uncommon figure in her circle,
and she esteems him, <i>l&rsquo;homme aux rubans verts</i>, &lsquo;who
sometimes diverts but more often horribly vexes her,&rsquo; as she can
say of him when her satirical tongue is on the run.&nbsp; Unhappily
the soul of truth in him, which wins her esteem, refuses to be tamed,
or silent, or unsuspicious, and is the perpetual obstacle to their good
accord.&nbsp; He is that melancholy person, the critic of everybody
save himself; intensely sensitive to the faults of others, wounded by
them; in love with his own indubitable honesty, and with his ideal of
the simpler form of life befitting it: qualities which constitute the
satirist.&nbsp; He is a Jean Jacques of the Court.&nbsp; His proposal
to C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne when he pardons her, that she should follow
him in flying humankind, and his frenzy of detestation of her at her
refusal, are thoroughly in the mood of Jean Jacques.&nbsp; He is an
impracticable creature of a priceless virtue; but C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne
may feel that to fly with him to the desert: that is from the Court
to the country</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O&ugrave; d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre homme d&rsquo;honneur
on ait la libert&eacute;,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>she is likely to find herself the companion of a starving satirist,
like that poor princess who ran away with the waiting-man, and when
both were hungry in the forest, was ordered to give him flesh.&nbsp;
She is a <i>fieff&eacute;e</i> coquette, rejoicing in her wit and her
attractions, and distinguished by her inclination for Alceste in the
midst of her many other lovers; only she finds it hard to cut them off&mdash;what
woman with a train does not?&mdash;and when the exposure of her naughty
wit has laid her under their rebuke, she will do the utmost she can:
she will give her hand to honesty, but she cannot quite abandon worldliness.&nbsp;
She would be unwise if she did.</p>
<p>The fable is thin.&nbsp; Our pungent contrivers of plots would see
no indication of life in the outlines.&nbsp; The life of the comedy
is in the idea.&nbsp; As with the singing of the sky-lark out of sight,
you must love the bird to be attentive to the song, so in this highest
flight of the Comic Muse, you must love pure Comedy warmly to understand
the Misanthrope: you must be receptive of the idea of Comedy.&nbsp;
And to love Comedy you must know the real world, and know men and women
well enough not to expect too much of them, though you may still hope
for good.</p>
<p>Menander wrote a comedy called Misogynes, said to have been the most
celebrated of his works.&nbsp; This misogynist is a married man, according
to the fragment surviving, and is a hater of women through hatred of
his wife.&nbsp; He generalizes upon them from the example of this lamentable
adjunct of his fortunes, and seems to have got the worst of it in the
contest with her, which is like the issue in reality, in the polite
world.&nbsp; He seems also to have deserved it, which may be as true
to the copy.&nbsp; But we are unable to say whether the wife was a good
voice of her sex: or how far Menander in this instance raised the idea
of woman from the mire it was plunged into by the comic poets, or rather
satiric dramatists, of the middle period of Greek Comedy preceding him
and the New Comedy, who devoted their wit chiefly to the abuse, and
for a diversity, to the eulogy of extra-mural ladies of conspicuous
fame.&nbsp; Menander idealized them without purposely elevating.&nbsp;
He satirized a certain Thais, and his Thais of the Eunuchus of Terence
is neither professionally attractive nor repulsive; his picture of the
two Andrians, Chrysis and her sister, is nowhere to be matched for tenderness.&nbsp;
But the condition of honest women in his day did not permit of the freedom
of action and fencing dialectic of a C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne, and consequently
it is below our mark of pure Comedy.</p>
<p>Sainte-Beuve conjures up the ghost of Menander, saying: For the love
of me love Terence.&nbsp; It is through love of Terence that moderns
are able to love Menander; and what is preserved of Terence has not
apparently given us the best of the friend of Epicurus.&nbsp; &Mu;&iota;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
the lover taken in horror, and &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;
the damsel shorn of her locks, have a promising sound for scenes of
jealousy and a too masterful display of lordly authority, leading to
regrets, of the kind known to intemperate men who imagined they were
fighting with the weaker, as the fragments indicate.</p>
<p>Of the six comedies of Terence, four are derived from Menander; two,
the Hecyra and the Phormio, from Apollodorus.&nbsp; These two are inferior
in comic action and the peculiar sweetness of Menander to the Andria,
the Adelphi, the Heautontimorumenus, and the Eunuchus: but Phormio is
a more dashing and amusing convivial parasite than the Gnatho of the
last-named comedy.&nbsp; There were numerous rivals of whom we know
next to nothing&mdash;except by the quotations of Athen&aelig;us and
Plutarch, and the Greek grammarians who cited them to support a dictum&mdash;in
this as in the preceding periods of comedy in Athens, for Menander&rsquo;s
plays are counted by many scores, and they were crowned by the prize
only eight times.&nbsp; The favourite poet with critics, in Greece as
in Rome, was Menander; and if some of his rivals here and there surpassed
him in comic force, and out-stripped him in competition by an appositeness
to the occasion that had previously in the same way deprived the genius
of Aristophanes of its due reward in Clouds and Birds, his position
as chief of the comic poets of his age was unchallenged.&nbsp; Plutarch
very unnecessarily drags Aristophanes into a comparison with him, to
the confusion of the older poet.&nbsp; Their aims, the matter they dealt
in, and the times, were quite dissimilar.&nbsp; But it is no wonder
that Plutarch, writing when Athenian beauty of style was the delight
of his patrons, should rank Menander at the highest.&nbsp; In what degree
of faithfulness Terence copied Menander, whether, as he states of the
passage in the Adelphi taken from Diphilus, <i>verbum de verbo</i> in
the lovelier scenes&mdash;the description of the last words of the dying
Andrian, and of her funeral, for instance&mdash;remains conjectural.&nbsp;
For us Terence shares with his master the praise of an amenity that
is like Elysian speech, equable and ever gracious; like the face of
the Andrian&rsquo;s young sister:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Adeo modesto, adeo venusto, ut nihil supra.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The celebrated &lsquo;flens quam familiariter,&rsquo; of which the
closest rendering grounds hopelessly on harsh prose, to express the
sorrowful confidingness of a young girl who has lost her sister and
dearest friend, and has but her lover left to her; &lsquo;she turned
and flung herself on his bosom, weeping as though at home there&rsquo;:
this our instinct tells us must be Greek, though hardly finer in Greek.&nbsp;
Certain lines of Terence, compared with the original fragments, show
that he embellished them; but his taste was too exquisite for him to
do other than devote his genius to the honest translation of such pieces
as the above.&nbsp; Menander, then; with him, through the affinity of
sympathy, Terence; and Shakespeare and Moli&egrave;re have this beautiful
translucency of language: and the study of the comic poets might be
recommended, if for that only.</p>
<p>A singular ill fate befell the writings of Menander.&nbsp; What we
have of him in Terence was chosen probably to please the cultivated
Romans; <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a> and is
a romantic play with a comic intrigue, obtained in two instances, the
Andria and the Eunuchus, by rolling a couple of his originals into one.&nbsp;
The titles of certain of the lost plays indicate the comic illumining
character; a Self-pitier, a Self-chastiser, an Ill-tempered man, a Superstitious,
an Incredulous, etc., point to suggestive domestic themes.</p>
<p>Terence forwarded manuscript translations from Greece, that suffered
shipwreck; he, who could have restored the treasure, died on the way
home.&nbsp; The zealots of Byzantium completed the work of destruction.&nbsp;
So we have the four comedies of Terence, numbering six of Menander,
with a few sketches of plots&mdash;one of them, the Thesaurus, introduces
a miser, whom we should have liked to contrast with Harpagon&mdash;and
a multitude of small fragments of a sententious cast, fitted for quotation.&nbsp;
Enough remains to make his greatness felt.</p>
<p>Without undervaluing other writers of Comedy, I think it may be said
that Menander and Moli&egrave;re stand alone specially as comic poets
of the feelings and the idea.&nbsp; In each of them there is a conception
of the Comic that refines even to pain, as in the Menedemus of the Heautontimorumenus,
and in the Misanthrope.&nbsp; Menander and Moli&egrave;re have given
the principal types to Comedy hitherto.&nbsp; The Micio and Demea of
the Adelphi, with their opposing views of the proper management of youth,
are still alive; the Sganarelles and Arnolphes of the &Eacute;cole des
Maris and the &Eacute;cole des Femmes, are not all buried.&nbsp; Tartuffe
is the father of the hypocrites; Orgon of the dupes; Thraso, of the
braggadocios; Alceste of the &lsquo;Manlys&rsquo;; Davus and Syrus of
the intriguing valets, the Scapins and Figaros.&nbsp; Ladies that soar
in the realms of Rose-Pink, whose language wears the nodding plumes
of intellectual conceit, are traceable to Philaminte and B&eacute;lise
of the Femmes Savantes: and the mordant witty women have the tongue
of C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne.&nbsp; The reason is, that these two poets
idealized upon life: the foundation of their types is real and in the
quick, but they painted with spiritual strength, which is the solid
in Art.</p>
<p>The idealistic conceptions of Comedy gives breadth and opportunities
of daring to Comic genius, and helps to solve the difficulties it creates.&nbsp;
How, for example, shall an audience be assured that an evident and monstrous
dupe is actually deceived without being an absolute fool?&nbsp; In Le
Tartuffe the note of high Comedy strikes when Orgon on his return home
hears of his idol&rsquo;s excellent appetite.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Le pauvre
homme</i>!&rsquo; he exclaims.&nbsp; He is told that the wife of his
bosom has been unwell.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Et Tartuffe</i>?&rsquo; he asks,
impatient to hear him spoken of, his mind suffused with the thought
of Tartuffe, crazy with tenderness, and again he croons, &lsquo;<i>Le
pauvre homme</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the mother&rsquo;s cry of pitying
delight at a nurse&rsquo;s recital of the feats in young animal gluttony
of her cherished infant.&nbsp; After this masterstroke of the Comic,
you not only put faith in Orgon&rsquo;s roseate prepossession, you share
it with him by comic sympathy, and can listen with no more than a tremble
of the laughing muscles to the instance he gives of the sublime humanity
of Tartuffe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Un rien presque suffit pour le scandaliser,<br />
Jusque-l&agrave;, qu&rsquo;il se vint l&rsquo;autre jour accuser<br />
D&rsquo;avoir pris une puce en faisant sa pri&egrave;re,<br />
Et de l&rsquo;avoir tu&eacute;e avec trop de col&egrave;re.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to have killed it too wrathfully!&nbsp; Translating Moli&egrave;re
is like humming an air one has heard performed by an accomplished violinist
of the pure tones without flourish.</p>
<p>Orgon, awakening to find another dupe in Madame Pernelle, incredulous
of the revelations which have at last opened his own besotted eyes,
is a scene of the double Comic, vivified by the spell previously cast
on the mind.&nbsp; There we feel the power of the poet&rsquo;s creation;
and in the sharp light of that sudden turn the humanity is livelier
than any realistic work can make it.</p>
<p>Italian Comedy gives many hints for a Tartuffe; but they may be found
in Boccaccio, as well as in Machiavelli&rsquo;s Mandragola.&nbsp; The
Frate Timoteo of this piece is only a very oily friar, compliantly assisting
an intrigue with ecclesiastical sophisms (to use the mildest word) for
payment.&nbsp; Frate Timoteo has a fine Italian priestly pose.</p>
<p>DONNA: Credete voi, che&rsquo;l Turco passi questo anno in Italia?</p>
<p>F. TIM.: Se voi non fate orazione, si.</p>
<p>Priestly arrogance and unctuousness, and trickeries and casuistries,
cannot be painted without our discovering a likeness in the long Italian
gallery.&nbsp; Goldoni sketched the Venetian manners of the decadence
of the Republic with a French pencil, and was an Italian Scribe in style.</p>
<p>The Spanish stage is richer in such Comedies as that which furnished
the idea of the Menteur to Corneille.&nbsp; But you must force yourself
to believe that this liar is not forcing his vein when he piles lie
upon lie.&nbsp; There is no preceding touch to win the mind to credulity.&nbsp;
Spanish Comedy is generally in sharp outline, as of skeletons; in quick
movement, as of marionnettes.&nbsp; The Comedy might be performed by
a troop of the <i>corps de ballet</i>; and in the recollection of the
reading it resolves to an animated shuffle of feet.&nbsp; It is, in
fact, something other than the true idea of Comedy.&nbsp; Where the
sexes are separated, men and women grow, as the Portuguese call it,
<i>affaimados</i> of one another, famine-stricken; and all the tragic
elements are on the stage.&nbsp; Don Juan is a comic character that
sends souls flying: nor does the humour of the breaking of a dozen women&rsquo;s
hearts conciliate the Comic Muse with the drawing of blood.</p>
<p>German attempts at Comedy remind one vividly of Heine&rsquo;s image
of his country in the dancing of Atta Troll.&nbsp; Lessing tried his
hand at it, with a sobering effect upon readers.&nbsp; The intention
to produce the reverse effect is just visible, and therein, like the
portly graces of the poor old Pyrenean Bear poising and twirling on
his right hind-leg and his left, consists the fun.&nbsp; Jean Paul Richter
gives the best edition of the German Comic in the contrast of Siebenk&auml;s
with his Lenette.&nbsp; A light of the Comic is in Goethe; enough to
complete the splendid figure of the man, but no more.</p>
<p>The German literary laugh, like the timed awakenings of their Barbarossa
in the hollows of the Untersberg, is infrequent, and rather monstrous&mdash;never
a laugh of men and women in concert.&nbsp; It comes of unrefined abstract
fancy, grotesque or grim, or gross, like the peculiar humours of their
little earthmen.&nbsp; Spiritual laughter they have not yet attained
to: sentimentalism waylays them in the flight.&nbsp; Here and there
a Volkslied or M&auml;rchen shows a national aptitude for stout animal
laughter; and we see that the literature is built on it, which is hopeful
so far; but to enjoy it, to enter into the philosophy of the Broad Grin,
that seems to hesitate between the skull and the embryo, and reaches
its perfection in breadth from the pulling of two square fingers at
the corners of the mouth, one must have aid of &lsquo;the good Rhine
wine,&rsquo; and be of German blood unmixed besides.&nbsp; This treble-Dutch
lumbersomeness of the Comic spirit is of itself exclusive of the idea
of Comedy, and the poor voice allowed to women in German domestic life
will account for the absence of comic dialogues reflecting upon life
in that land.&nbsp; I shall speak of it again in the second section
of this lecture.</p>
<p>Eastward you have total silence of Comedy among a people intensely
susceptible to laughter, as the Arabian Nights will testify.&nbsp; Where
the veil is over women&rsquo;s-faces, you cannot have society, without
which the senses are barbarous and the Comic spirit is driven to the
gutters of grossness to slake its thirst.&nbsp; Arabs in this respect
are worse than Italians&mdash;much worse than Germans; just in the degree
that their system of treating women is worse.</p>
<p>M. Saint-Marc Girardin, the excellent French essayist and master
of critical style, tells of a conversation he had once with an Arab
gentleman on the topic of the different management of these difficult
creatures in Orient and in Occident: and the Arab spoke in praise of
many good results of the greater freedom enjoyed by Western ladies,
and the charm of conversing with them.&nbsp; He was questioned why his
countrymen took no measures to grant them something of that kind of
liberty.&nbsp; He jumped out of his individuality in a twinkling, and
entered into the sentiments of his race, replying, from the pinnacle
of a splendid conceit, with affected humility of manner: &lsquo;<i>You</i>
can look on them without perturbation&mdash;but <i>we</i>!&rsquo; .
. . And after this profoundly comic interjection, he added, in deep
tones, &lsquo;The very face of a woman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Our representative
of temperate notions demurely consented that the Arab&rsquo;s pride
of inflammability should insist on the prudery of the veil as the civilizing
medium of his race.</p>
<p>There has been fun in Bagdad.&nbsp; But there never will be civilization
where Comedy is not possible; and that comes of some degree of social
equality of the sexes.&nbsp; I am not quoting the Arab to exhort and
disturb the somnolent East; rather for cultivated women to recognize
that the Comic Muse is one of their best friends.&nbsp; They are blind
to their interests in swelling the ranks of the sentimentalists.&nbsp;
Let them look with their clearest vision abroad and at home.&nbsp; They
will see that where they have no social freedom, Comedy is absent: where
they are household drudges, the form of Comedy is primitive: where they
are tolerably independent, but uncultivated, exciting melodrama takes
its place and a sentimental version of them.&nbsp; Yet the Comic will
out, as they would know if they listened to some of the private conversations
of men whose minds are undirected by the Comic Muse: as the sentimental
man, to his astonishment, would know likewise, if he in similar fashion
could receive a lesson.&nbsp; But where women are on the road to an
equal footing with men, in attainments and in liberty&mdash;in what
they have won for themselves, and what has been granted them by a fair
civilization&mdash;there, and only waiting to be transplanted from life
to the stage, or the novel, or the poem, pure Comedy flourishes, and
is, as it would help them to be, the sweetest of diversions, the wisest
of delightful companions.</p>
<p>Now, to look about us in the present time, I think it will be acknowledged
that in neglecting the cultivation of the Comic idea, we are losing
the aid of a powerful auxiliar.&nbsp; You see Folly perpetually sliding
into new shapes in a society possessed of wealth and leisure, with many
whims, many strange ailments and strange doctors.&nbsp; Plenty of common-sense
is in the world to thrust her back when she pretends to empire.&nbsp;
But the first-born of common-sense, the vigilant Comic, which is the
genius of thoughtful laughter, which would readily extinguish her at
the outset, is not serving as a public advocate.</p>
<p>You will have noticed the disposition of common-sense, under pressure
of some pertinacious piece of light-headedness, to grow impatient and
angry.&nbsp; That is a sign of the absence, or at least of the dormancy,
of the Comic idea.&nbsp; For Folly is the natural prey of the Comic,
known to it in all her transformations, in every disguise; and it is
with the springing delight of hawk over heron, hound after fox, that
it gives her chase, never fretting, never tiring, sure of having her,
allowing her no rest.</p>
<p>Contempt is a sentiment that cannot be entertained by comic intelligence.&nbsp;
What is it but an excuse to be idly minded, or personally lofty, or
comfortably narrow, not perfectly humane?&nbsp; If we do not feign when
we say that we despise Folly, we shut the brain.&nbsp; There is a disdainful
attitude in the presence of Folly, partaking of the foolishness to Comic
perception: and anger is not much less foolish than disdain.&nbsp; The
struggle we have to conduct is essence against essence.&nbsp; Let no
one doubt of the sequel when this emanation of what is firmest in us
is launched to strike down the daughter of Unreason and Sentimentalism:
such being Folly&rsquo;s parentage, when it is respectable.</p>
<p>Our modern system of combating her is too long defensive, and carried
on too ploddingly with concrete engines of war in the attack.&nbsp;
She has time to get behind entrenchments.&nbsp; She is ready to stand
a siege, before the heavily armed man of science and the writer of the
leading article or elaborate essay have primed their big guns.&nbsp;
It should be remembered that she has charms for the multitude; and an
English multitude seeing her make a gallant fight of it will be half
in love with her, certainly willing to lend her a cheer.&nbsp; Benevolent
subscriptions assist her to hire her own man of science, her own organ
in the Press.&nbsp; If ultimately she is cast out and overthrown, she
can stretch a finger at gaps in our ranks.&nbsp; She can say that she
commanded an army and seduced men, whom we thought sober men and safe,
to act as her lieutenants.&nbsp; We learn rather gloomily, after she
has flashed her lantern, that we have in our midst able men and men
with minds for whom there is no pole-star in intellectual navigation.&nbsp;
Comedy, or the Comic element, is the specific for the poison of delusion
while Folly is passing from the state of vapour to substantial form.</p>
<p>O for a breath of Aristophanes, Rabelais, Voltaire, Cervantes, Fielding,
Moli&egrave;re!&nbsp; These are spirits that, if you know them well,
will come when you do call.&nbsp; You will find the very invocation
of them act on you like a renovating air&mdash;the South-west coming
off the sea, or a cry in the Alps.</p>
<p>No one would presume to say that we are deficient in jokers.&nbsp;
They abound, and the organisation directing their machinery to shoot
them in the wake of the leading article and the popular sentiment is
good.</p>
<p>But the Comic differs from them in addressing the wits for laughter;
and the sluggish wits want some training to respond to it, whether in
public life or private, and particularly when the feelings are excited.</p>
<p>The sense of the Comic is much blunted by habits of punning and of
using humouristic phrase: the trick of employing Johnsonian polysyllables
to treat of the infinitely little.&nbsp; And it really may be humorous,
of a kind, yet it will miss the point by going too much round about
it.</p>
<p>A certain French Duke Pasquier died, some years back, at a very advanced
age.&nbsp; He had been the venerable Duke Pasquier in his later years
up to the period of his death.&nbsp; There was a report of Duke Pasquier
that he was a man of profound egoism.&nbsp; Hence an argument arose,
and was warmly sustained, upon the excessive selfishness of those who,
in a world of troubles, and calls to action, and innumerable duties,
husband their strength for the sake of living on.&nbsp; Can it be possible,
the argument ran, for a truly generous heart to continue beating up
to the age of a hundred?&nbsp; Duke Pasquier was not without his defenders,
who likened him to the oak of the forest&mdash;a venerable comparison.</p>
<p>The argument was conducted on both sides with spirit and earnestness,
lightened here and there by frisky touches of the polysyllabic playful,
reminding one of the serious pursuit of their fun by truant boys, that
are assured they are out of the eye of their master, and now and then
indulge in an imitation of him.&nbsp; And well might it be supposed
that the Comic idea was asleep, not overlooking them!&nbsp; It resolved
at last to this, that either Duke Pasquier was a scandal on our humanity
in clinging to life so long, or that he honoured it by so sturdy a resistance
to the enemy.&nbsp; As one who has entangled himself in a labyrinth
is glad to get out again at the entrance, the argument ran about to
conclude with its commencement.</p>
<p>Now, imagine a master of the Comic treating this theme, and particularly
the argument on it.&nbsp; Imagine an Aristophanic comedy of THE CENTENARIAN,
with choric praises of heroical early death, and the same of a stubborn
vitality, and the poet laughing at the chorus; and the grand question
for contention in dialogue, as to the exact age when a man should die,
to the identical minute, that he may preserve the respect of his fellows,
followed by a systematic attempt to make an accurate measurement in
parallel lines, with a tough rope-yarn by one party, and a string of
yawns by the other, of the veteran&rsquo;s power of enduring life, and
our capacity for enduring <i>him</i>, with tremendous pulling on both
sides.</p>
<p>Would not the Comic view of the discussion illumine it and the disputants
like very lightning?&nbsp; There are questions, as well as persons,
that only the Comic can fitly touch.</p>
<p>Aristophanes would probably have crowned the ancient tree, with the
consolatory observation to the haggard line of long-expectant heirs
of the Centenarian, that they live to see the blessedness of coming
of a strong stock.&nbsp; The shafts of his ridicule would mainly have
been aimed at the disputants.&nbsp; For the sole ground of the argument
was the old man&rsquo;s character, and sophists are not needed to demonstrate
that we can very soon have too much of a bad thing.&nbsp; A Centenarian
does not necessarily provoke the Comic idea, nor does the corpse of
a duke.&nbsp; It is not provoked in the order of nature, until we draw
its penetrating attentiveness to some circumstance with which we have
been mixing our private interests, or our speculative obfuscation.&nbsp;
Dulness, insensible to the Comic, has the privilege of arousing it;
and the laying of a dull finger on matters of human life is the surest
method of establishing electrical communications with a battery of laughter&mdash;where
the Comic idea is prevalent.</p>
<p>But if the Comic idea prevailed with us, and we had an Aristophanes
to barb and wing it, we should be breathing air of Athens.&nbsp; Prosers
now pouring forth on us like public fountains would be cut short in
the street and left blinking, dumb as pillar-posts, with letters thrust
into their mouths.&nbsp; We should throw off incubus, our dreadful familiar&mdash;by
some called boredom&mdash;whom it is our present humiliation to be just
alive enough to loathe, never quick enough to foil.&nbsp; There would
be a bright and positive, clear Hellenic perception of facts.&nbsp;
The vapours of Unreason and Sentimentalism would be blown away before
they were productive.&nbsp; Where would Pessimist and Optimist be?&nbsp;
They would in any case have a diminished audience.&nbsp; Yet possibly
the change of despots, from good-natured old obtuseness to keen-edged
intelligence, which is by nature merciless, would be more than we could
bear.&nbsp; The rupture of the link between dull people, consisting
in the fraternal agreement that something is too clever for them, and
a shot beyond them, is not to be thought of lightly; for, slender though
the link may seem, it is equivalent to a cement forming a concrete of
dense cohesion, very desirable in the estimation of the statesman.</p>
<p>A political Aristophanes, taking advantage of his lyrical Bacchic
licence, was found too much for political Athens.&nbsp; I would not
ask to have him revived, but that the sharp light of such a spirit as
his might be with us to strike now and then on public affairs, public
themes, to make them spin along more briskly.</p>
<p>He hated with the politician&rsquo;s fervour the sophist who corrupted
simplicity of thought, the poet who destroyed purity of style, the demagogue,
&lsquo;the saw-toothed monster,&rsquo; who, as he conceived, chicaned
the mob, and he held his own against them by strength of laughter, until
fines, the curtailing of his Comic licence in the chorus, and ultimately
the ruin of Athens, which could no longer support the expense of the
chorus, threw him altogether on dialogue, and brought him under the
law.&nbsp; After the catastrophe, the poet, who had ever been gazing
back at the men of Marathon and Salamis, must have felt that he had
foreseen it; and that he was wise when he pleaded for peace, and derided
military coxcombry, and the captious old creature Demus, we can admit.&nbsp;
He had the Comic poet&rsquo;s gift of common-sense&mdash;which does
not always include political intelligence; yet his political tendency
raised him above the Old Comedy turn for uproarious farce.&nbsp; He
abused Socrates, but Xenophon, the disciple of Socrates, by his trained
rhetoric saved the Ten Thousand.&nbsp; Aristophanes might say that if
his warnings had been followed there would have been no such thing as
a mercenary Greek expedition under Cyrus.&nbsp; Athens, however, was
on a landslip, falling; none could arrest it.&nbsp; To gaze back, to
uphold the old times, was a most natural conservatism, and fruitless.&nbsp;
The aloe had bloomed.&nbsp; Whether right or wrong in his politics and
his criticisms, and bearing in mind the instruments he played on and
the audience he had to win, there is an idea in his comedies: it is
the Idea of Good Citizenship.</p>
<p>He is not likely to be revived.&nbsp; He stands, like Shakespeare,
an unapproachable.&nbsp; Swift says of him, with a loving chuckle:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But as for Comic Aristophanes,<br />
The dog too witty and too pr&oacute;fane is.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aristophanes was &lsquo;pr&oacute;fane,&rsquo; under satiric direction,
unlike his rivals Cratinus, Phrynichus, Ameipsias, Eupolis, and others,
if we are to believe him, who in their extraordinary Donnybrook Fair
of the day of Comedy, thumped one another and everybody else with absolute
heartiness, as he did, but aimed at small game, and dragged forth particular
women, which he did not.&nbsp; He is an aggregate of many men, all of
a certain greatness.&nbsp; We may build up a conception of his powers
if we mount Rabelais upon Hudibras, lift him with the songfulness of
Shelley, give him a vein of Heinrich Heine, and cover him with the mantle
of the Anti-Jacobin, adding (that there may be some Irish in him) a
dash of Grattan, before he is in motion.</p>
<p>But such efforts at conceiving one great one by incorporation of
minors are vain, and cry for excuse.&nbsp; Supposing Wilkes for leading
man in a country constantly plunging into war under some plumed Lamachus,
with enemies periodically firing the land up to the gates of London,
and a Samuel Foote, of prodigious genius, attacking him with ridicule,
I think it gives a notion of the conflict engaged in by Aristophanes.&nbsp;
This laughing bald-pate, as he calls himself, was a Titanic pamphleteer,
using laughter for his political weapon; a laughter without scruple,
the laughter of Hercules.&nbsp; He was primed with wit, as with the
garlic he speaks of giving to the game-cocks, to make them fight the
better.&nbsp; And he was a lyric poet of a&euml;rial delicacy, with
the homely song of a jolly national poet, and a poet of such feeling
that the comic mask is at times no broader than a cloth on a face to
show the serious features of our common likeness.&nbsp; He is not to
be revived; but if his method were studied, some of the fire in him
would come to us, and we might be revived.</p>
<p>Taking them generally, the English public are most in sympathy with
this primitive Aristophanic comedy, wherein the comic is capped by the
grotesque, irony tips the wit, and satire is a naked sword.&nbsp; They
have the basis of the Comic in them: an esteem for common-sense.&nbsp;
They cordially dislike the reverse of it.&nbsp; They have a rich laugh,
though it is not the <i>gros rire</i> of the Gaul tossing <i>gros sel</i>,
nor the polished Frenchman&rsquo;s mentally digestive laugh.&nbsp; And
if they have now, like a monarch with a troop of dwarfs, too many jesters
kicking the dictionary about, to let them reflect that they are dull,
occasionally, like the pensive monarch surprising himself with an idea
of an idea of his own, they look so.&nbsp; And they are given to looking
in the glass.&nbsp; They must see that something ails them.&nbsp; How
much even the better order of them will endure, without a thought of
the defensive, when the person afflicting them is protected from satire,
we read in Memoirs of a Preceding Age, where the vulgarly tyrannous
hostess of a great house of reception shuffled the guests and played
them like a pack of cards, with her exact estimate of the strength of
each one printed on them: and still this house continued to be the most
popular in England; nor did the lady ever appear in print or on the
boards as the comic type that she was.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that they have not yet spiritually comprehended
the signification of living in society; for who are cheerfuller, brisker
of wit, in the fields, and as explorers, colonisers, backwoodsmen?&nbsp;
They are happy in rough exercise, and also in complete repose.&nbsp;
The intermediate condition, when they are called upon to talk to one
another, upon other than affairs of business or their hobbies, reveals
them wearing a curious look of vacancy, as it were the socket of an
eye wanting.&nbsp; The Comic is perpetually springing up in social life,
and, it oppresses them from not being perceived.</p>
<p>Thus, at a dinner-party, one of the guests, who happens to have enrolled
himself in a Burial Company, politely entreats the others to inscribe
their names as shareholders, expatiating on the advantages accruing
to them in the event of their very possible speedy death, the salubrity
of the site, the aptitude of the soil for a quick consumption of their
remains, etc.; and they drink sadness from the incongruous man, and
conceive indigestion, not seeing him in a sharply defined light, that
would bid them taste the comic of him.&nbsp; Or it is mentioned that
a newly elected member of our Parliament celebrates his arrival at eminence
by the publication of a book on cab-fares, dedicated to a beloved female
relative deceased, and the comment on it is the word &lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But, merely for a contrast, turn to a not uncommon scene of yesterday
in the hunting-field, where a brilliant young rider, having broken his
collar-bone, trots away very soon after, against medical interdict,
half put together in splinters, to the most distant meet of his neighbourhood,
sure of escaping his doctor, who is the first person he encounters.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I came here purposely to avoid you,&rsquo; says the patient.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I came here purposely to take care of you,&rsquo; says the doctor.&nbsp;
Off they go, and come to a swollen brook.&nbsp; The patient clears it
handsomely: the doctor tumbles in.&nbsp; All the field are alive with
the heartiest relish of every incident and every cross-light on it;
and dull would the man have been thought who had not his word to say
about it when riding home.</p>
<p>In our prose literature we have had delightful Comic writers.&nbsp;
Besides Fielding and Goldsmith, there is Miss Austen, whose Emma and
Mr. Elton might walk straight into a comedy, were the plot arranged
for them.&nbsp; Galt&rsquo;s neglected novels have some characters and
strokes of shrewd comedy.&nbsp; In our poetic literature the comic is
delicate and graceful above the touch of Italian and French.&nbsp; Generally,
however, the English elect excel in satire, and they are noble humourists.&nbsp;
The national disposition is for hard-hitting, with a moral purpose to
sanction it; or for a rosy, sometimes a larmoyant, geniality, not unmanly
in its verging upon tenderness, and with a singular attraction for thick-headedness,
to decorate it with asses&rsquo; ears and the most beautiful sylvan
haloes.&nbsp; But the Comic is a different spirit.</p>
<p>You may estimate your capacity for Comic perception by being able
to detect the ridicule of them you love, without loving them less: and
more by being able to see yourself somewhat ridiculous in dear eyes,
and accepting the correction their image of you proposes.</p>
<p>Each one of an affectionate couple may be willing, as we say, to
die for the other, yet unwilling to utter the agreeable word at the
right moment; but if the wits were sufficiently quick for them to perceive
that they are in a comic situation, as affectionate couples must be
when they quarrel, they would not wait for the moon or the almanac,
or a Dorine, to bring back the flood-tide of tender feelings, that they
should join hands and lips.</p>
<p>If you detect the ridicule, and your kindliness is chilled by it,
you are slipping into the grasp of Satire.</p>
<p>If instead of falling foul of the ridiculous person with a satiric
rod, to make him writhe and shriek aloud, you prefer to sting him under
a semi-caress, by which he shall in his anguish be rendered dubious
whether indeed anything has hurt him, you are an engine of Irony.</p>
<p>If you laugh all round him, tumble him, roll him about, deal him
a smack, and drop a tear on him, own his likeness to you and yours to
your neighbour, spare him as little as you shun, pity him as much as
you expose, it is a spirit of Humour that is moving you.</p>
<p>The Comic, which is the perceptive, is the governing spirit, awakening
and giving aim to these powers of laughter, but it is not to be confounded
with them: it enfolds a thinner form of them, differing from satire,
in not sharply driving into the quivering sensibilities, and from humour,
in not comforting them and tucking them up, or indicating a broader
than the range of this bustling world to them.</p>
<p>Fielding&rsquo;s Jonathan Wild presents a case of this peculiar distinction,
when that man of eminent greatness remarks upon the unfairness of a
trial in which the condemnation has been brought about by twelve men
of the opposite party; for it is not satiric, it is not humorous; yet
it is immensely comic to hear a guilty villain protesting that his own
&lsquo;party&rsquo; should have a voice in the Law.&nbsp; It opens an
avenue into villains&rsquo; ratiocination. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9">{9}</a>&nbsp;
And the Comic is not cancelled though we should suppose Jonathan to
be giving play to his humour.&nbsp; I may have dreamed this or had it
suggested to me, for on referring to Jonathan Wild, I do not find it.</p>
<p>Apply the case to the man of deep wit, who is ever certain of his
condemnation by the opposite party, and then it ceases to be comic,
and will be satiric.</p>
<p>The look of Fielding upon Richardson is essentially comic.&nbsp;
His method of correcting the sentimental writer is a mixture of the
comic and the humorous.&nbsp; Parson Adams is a creation of humour.&nbsp;
But both the conception and the presentation of Alceste and of Tartuffe,
of C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne and Philaminte, are purely comic, addressed
to the intellect: there is no humour in them, and they refresh the intellect
they quicken to detect their comedy, by force of the contrast they offer
between themselves and the wiser world about them; that is to say, society,
or that assemblage of minds whereof the Comic spirit has its origin.</p>
<p>Byron had splendid powers of humour, and the most poetic satire that
we have example of, fusing at times to hard irony.&nbsp; He had no strong
comic sense, or he would not have taken an anti-social position, which
is directly opposed to the Comic; and in his philosophy, judged by philosophers,
he is a comic figure, by reason of this deficiency.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
bald er philosophirt ist er ein Kind,&rsquo; Goethe says of him.&nbsp;
Carlyle sees him in this comic light, treats him in the humorous manner.</p>
<p>The Satirist is a moral agent, often a social scavenger, working
on a storage of bile.</p>
<p>The Irone&iuml;st is one thing or another, according to his caprice.&nbsp;
Irony is the humour of satire; it may be savage as in Swift, with a
moral object, or sedate, as in Gibbon, with a malicious.&nbsp; The foppish
irony fretting to be seen, and the irony which leers, that you shall
not mistake its intention, are failures in satiric effort pretending
to the treasures of ambiguity.</p>
<p>The Humourist of mean order is a refreshing laugher, giving tone
to the feelings and sometimes allowing the feelings to be too much for
him.&nbsp; But the humourist of high has an embrace of contrasts beyond
the scope of the Comic poet.</p>
<p>Heart and mind laugh out at Don Quixote, and still you brood on him.&nbsp;
The juxtaposition of the knight and squire is a Comic conception, the
opposition of their natures most humorous.&nbsp; They are as different
as the two hemispheres in the time of Columbus, yet they touch and are
bound in one by laughter.&nbsp; The knight&rsquo;s great aims and constant
mishaps, his chivalrous valiancy exercised on absurd objects, his good
sense along the highroad of the craziest of expeditions; the compassion
he plucks out of derision, and the admirable figure he preserves while
stalking through the frantically grotesque and burlesque assailing him,
are in the loftiest moods of humour, fusing the Tragic sentiment with
the Comic narrative.</p>
<p>The stroke of the great humourist is world-wide, with lights of Tragedy
in his laughter.</p>
<p>Taking a living great, though not creative, humourist to guide our
description: the skull of Yorick is in his hands in our seasons of festival;
he sees visions of primitive man capering preposterously under the gorgeous
robes of ceremonial.&nbsp; Our souls must be on fire when we wear solemnity,
if we would not press upon his shrewdest nerve.&nbsp; Finite and infinite
flash from one to the other with him, lending him a two-edged thought
that peeps out of his peacefullest lines by fits, like the lantern of
the fire-watcher at windows, going the rounds at night.&nbsp; The comportment
and performances of men in society are to him, by the vivid comparison
with their mortality, more grotesque than respectable.&nbsp; But ask
yourself, Is he always to be relied on for justness?&nbsp; He will fly
straight as the emissary eagle back to Jove at the true Hero.&nbsp;
He will also make as determined a swift descent upon the man of his
wilful choice, whom we cannot distinguish as a true one.&nbsp; This
vast power of his, built up of the feelings and the intellect in union,
is often wanting in proportion and in discretion.&nbsp; Humourists touching
upon History or Society are given to be capricious.&nbsp; They are,
as in the case of Sterne, given to be sentimental; for with them the
feelings are primary, as with singers.&nbsp; Comedy, on the other hand,
is an interpretation of the general mind, and is for that reason of
necessity kept in restraint.&nbsp; The French lay marked stress on <i>mesure
et go&ucirc;t</i>, and they own how much they owe to Moli&egrave;re
for leading them in simple justness and taste.&nbsp; We can teach them
many things; they can teach us in this.</p>
<p>The Comic poet is in the narrow field, or enclosed square, of the
society he depicts; and he addresses the still narrower enclosure of
men&rsquo;s intellects, with reference to the operation of the social
world upon their characters.&nbsp; He is not concerned with beginnings
or endings or surroundings, but with what you are now weaving.&nbsp;
To understand his work and value it, you must have a sober liking of
your kind and a sober estimate of our civilized qualities.&nbsp; The
aim and business of the Comic poet are misunderstood, his meaning is
not seized nor his point of view taken, when he is accused of dishonouring
our nature and being hostile to sentiment, tending to spitefulness and
making an unfair use of laughter.&nbsp; Those who detect irony in Comedy
do so because they choose to see it in life.&nbsp; Poverty, says the
satirist, has nothing harder in itself than that it makes men ridiculous.&nbsp;
But poverty is never ridiculous to Comic perception until it attempts
to make its rags conceal its bareness in a forlorn attempt at decency,
or foolishly to rival ostentation.&nbsp; Caleb Balderstone, in his endeavour
to keep up the honour of a noble household in a state of beggary, is
an exquisitely comic character.&nbsp; In the case of &lsquo;poor relatives,&rsquo;
on the other hand, it is the rich, whom they perplex, that are really
comic; and to laugh at the former, not seeing the comedy of the latter,
is to betray dulness of vision.&nbsp; Humourist and Satirist frequently
hunt together as Irone&iuml;sts in pursuit of the grotesque, to the
exclusion of the Comic.&nbsp; That was an affecting moment in the history
of the Prince Regent, when the First Gentleman of Europe burst into
tears at a sarcastic remark of Beau Brummell&rsquo;s on the cut of his
coat.&nbsp; Humour, Satire, Irony, pounce on it altogether as their
common prey.&nbsp; The Comic spirit eyes but does not touch it.&nbsp;
Put into action, it would be farcical.&nbsp; It is too gross for Comedy.</p>
<p>Incidents of a kind casting ridicule on our unfortunate nature instead
of our conventional life, provoke derisive laughter, which thwarts the
Comic idea.&nbsp; But derision is foiled by the play of the intellect.&nbsp;
Most of doubtful causes in contest are open to Comic interpretation,
and any intellectual pleading of a doubtful cause contains germs of
an Idea of Comedy.</p>
<p>The laughter of satire is a blow in the back or the face.&nbsp; The
laughter of Comedy is impersonal and of unrivalled politeness, nearer
a smile; often no more than a smile.&nbsp; It laughs through the mind,
for the mind directs it; and it might be called the humour of the mind.</p>
<p>One excellent test of the civilization of a country, as I have said,
I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy; and the test
of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.</p>
<p>If you believe that our civilization is founded in common-sense (and
it is the first condition of sanity to believe it), you will, when contemplating
men, discern a Spirit overhead; not more heavenly than the light flashed
upward from glassy surfaces, but luminous and watchful; never shooting
beyond them, nor lagging in the rear; so closely attached to them that
it may be taken for a slavish reflex, until its features are studied.&nbsp;
It has the sage&rsquo;s brows, and the sunny malice of a faun lurks
at the corners of the half-closed lips drawn in an idle wariness of
half tension.&nbsp; That slim feasting smile, shaped like the long-bow,
was once a big round satyr&rsquo;s laugh, that flung up the brows like
a fortress lifted by gunpowder.&nbsp; The laugh will come again, but
it will be of the order of the smile, finely tempered, showing sunlight
of the mind, mental richness rather than noisy enormity.&nbsp; Its common
aspect is one of unsolicitous observation, as if surveying a full field
and having leisure to dart on its chosen morsels, without any fluttering
eagerness.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s future upon earth does not attract it;
their honesty and shapeliness in the present does; and whenever they
wax out of proportion, overblown, affected, pretentious, bombastical,
hypocritical, pedantic, fantastically delicate; whenever it sees them
self-deceived or hoodwinked, given to run riot in idolatries, drifting
into vanities, congregating in absurdities, planning short-sightedly,
plotting dementedly; whenever they are at variance with their professions,
and violate the unwritten but perceptible laws binding them in consideration
one to another; whenever they offend sound reason, fair justice; are
false in humility or mined with conceit, individually, or in the bulk&mdash;the
Spirit overhead will look humanely malign and cast an oblique light
on them, followed by volleys of silvery laughter.&nbsp; That is the
Comic Spirit.</p>
<p>Not to distinguish it is to be bull-blind to the spiritual, and to
deny the existence of a mind of man where minds of men are in working
conjunction.</p>
<p>You must, as I have said, believe that our state of society is founded
in common-sense, otherwise you will not be struck by the contrasts the
Comic Spirit perceives, or have it to look to for your consolation.&nbsp;
You will, in fact, be standing in that peculiar oblique beam of light,
yourself illuminated to the general eye as the very object of chase
and doomed quarry of the thing obscure to you.&nbsp; But to feel its
presence and to see it is your assurance that many sane and solid minds
are with you in what you are experiencing: and this of itself spares
you the pain of satirical heat, and the bitter craving to strike heavy
blows.&nbsp; You share the sublime of wrath, that would not have hurt
the foolish, but merely demonstrate their foolishness.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re
was contented to revenge himself on the critics of the &Eacute;cole
des Femmes, by writing the Critique de l&rsquo;&Eacute;cole des Femmes,
one of the wisest as well as the playfullest of studies in criticism.&nbsp;
A perception of the comic spirit gives high fellowship.&nbsp; You become
a citizen of the selecter world, the highest we know of in connection
with our old world, which is not supermundane.&nbsp; Look there for
your unchallengeable upper class!&nbsp; You feel that you are one of
this our civilized community, that you cannot escape from it, and would
not if you could.&nbsp; Good hope sustains you; weariness does not overwhelm
you; in isolation you see no charms for vanity; personal pride is greatly
moderated.&nbsp; Nor shall your title of citizenship exclude you from
worlds of imagination or of devotion.&nbsp; The Comic spirit is not
hostile to the sweetest songfully poetic.&nbsp; Chaucer bubbles with
it: Shakespeare overflows: there is a mild moon&rsquo;s ray of it (pale
with super-refinement through distance from our flesh and blood planet)
in Comus.&nbsp; Pope has it, and it is the daylight side of the night
half obscuring Cowper.&nbsp; It is only hostile to the priestly element,
when that, by baleful swelling, transcends and overlaps the bounds of
its office: and then, in extreme cases, it is too true to itself to
speak, and veils the lamp: as, for example, the spectacle of Bossuet
over the dead body of Moli&egrave;re: at which the dark angels may,
but men do not laugh.</p>
<p>We have had comic pulpits, for a sign that the laughter-moving and
the worshipful may be in alliance: I know not how far comic, or how
much assisted in seeming so by the unexpectedness and the relief of
its appearance: at least they are popular, they are said to win the
ear.&nbsp; Laughter is open to perversion, like other good things; the
scornful and the brutal sorts are not unknown to us; but the laughter
directed by the Comic spirit is a harmless wine, conducing to sobriety
in the degree that it enlivens.&nbsp; It enters you like fresh air into
a study; as when one of the sudden contrasts of the comic idea floods
the brain like reassuring daylight.&nbsp; You are cognizant of the true
kind by feeling that you take it in, savour it, and have what flowers
live on, natural air for food.&nbsp; That which you give out&mdash;the
joyful roar&mdash;is not the better part; let that go to good fellowship
and the benefit of the lungs.&nbsp; Aristophanes promises his auditors
that if they will retain the ideas of the comic poet carefully, as they
keep dried fruits in boxes, their garments shall smell odoriferous of
wisdom throughout the year.&nbsp; The boast will not be thought an empty
one by those who have choice friends that have stocked themselves according
to his directions.&nbsp; Such treasuries of sparkling laughter are wells
in our desert.&nbsp; Sensitiveness to the comic laugh is a step in civilization.&nbsp;
To shrink from being an object of it is a step in cultivation.&nbsp;
We know the degree of refinement in men by the matter they will laugh
at, and the ring of the laugh; but we know likewise that the larger
natures are distinguished by the great breadth of their power of laughter,
and no one really loving Moli&egrave;re is refined by that love to despise
or be dense to Aristophanes, though it may be that the lover of Aristophanes
will not have risen to the height of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Embrace them
both, and you have the whole scale of laughter in your breast.&nbsp;
Nothing in the world surpasses in stormy fun the scene in The Frogs,
when Bacchus and Xanthias receive their thrashings from the hands of
businesslike &OElig;acus, to discover which is the divinity of the two,
by his imperviousness to the mortal condition of pain, and each, under
the obligation of not crying out, makes believe that his horrible bellow&mdash;the
god&rsquo;s <i>iou iou</i> being the lustier&mdash;means only the stopping
of a sneeze, or horseman sighted, or the prelude to an invocation to
some deity: and the slave contrives that the god shall get the bigger
lot of blows.&nbsp; Passages of Rabelais, one or two in Don Quixote,
and the Supper in the Manner of the Ancients, in Peregrine Pickle, are
of a similar cataract of laughter.&nbsp; But it is not illuminating;
it is not the laughter of the mind.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s laughter,
in his purest comedies, is ethereal, as light to our nature, as colour
to our thoughts.&nbsp; The Misanthrope and the Tartuffe have no audible
laughter; but the characters are steeped in the comic spirit.&nbsp;
They quicken the mind through laughter, from coming out of the mind;
and the mind accepts them because they are clear interpretations of
certain chapters of the Book lying open before us all.&nbsp; Between
these two stand Shakespeare and Cervantes, with the richer laugh of
heart and mind in one; with much of the Aristophanic robustness, something
of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s delicacy.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The laughter heard in circles not pervaded by the Comic idea, will
sound harsh and soulless, like versified prose, if you step into them
with a sense of the distinction.&nbsp; You will fancy you have changed
your habitation to a planet remoter from the sun.&nbsp; You may be among
powerful brains too.&nbsp; You will not find poets&mdash;or but a stray
one, over-worshipped.&nbsp; You will find learned men undoubtedly, professors,
reputed philosophers, and illustrious dilettanti.&nbsp; They have in
them, perhaps, every element composing light, except the Comic.&nbsp;
They read verse, they discourse of art; but their eminent faculties
are not under that vigilant sense of a collective supervision, spiritual
and present, which we have taken note of.&nbsp; They build a temple
of arrogance; they speak much in the voice of oracles; their hilarity,
if it does not dip in grossness, is usually a form of pugnacity.</p>
<p>Insufficiency of sight in the eye looking outward has deprived them
of the eye that should look inward.&nbsp; They have never weighed themselves
in the delicate balance of the Comic idea so as to obtain a suspicion
of the rights and dues of the world; and they have, in consequence,
an irritable personality.&nbsp; A very learned English professor crushed
an argument in a political discussion, by asking his adversary angrily:
&lsquo;Are you aware, sir, that I am a philologer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The practice of polite society will help in training them, and the
professor on a sofa with beautiful ladies on each side of him, may become
their pupil and a scholar in manners without knowing it: he is at least
a fair and pleasing spectacle to the Comic Muse.&nbsp; But the society
named polite is volatile in its adorations, and to-morrow will be petting
a bronzed soldier, or a black African, or a prince, or a spiritualist:
ideas cannot take root in its ever-shifting soil.&nbsp; It is besides
addicted in self-defence to gabble exclusively of the affairs of its
rapidly revolving world, as children on a whirligoround bestow their
attention on the wooden horse or cradle ahead of them, to escape from
giddiness and preserve a notion of identity.&nbsp; The professor is
better out of a circle that often confounds by lionizing, sometimes
annoys by abandoning, and always confuses.&nbsp; The school that teaches
gently what peril there is lest a cultivated head should still be coxcomb&rsquo;s,
and the collisions which may befall high-soaring minds, empty or full,
is more to be recommended than the sphere of incessant motion supplying
it with material.</p>
<p>Lands where the Comic spirit is obscure overhead are rank with raw
crops of matter.&nbsp; The traveller accustomed to smooth highways and
people not covered with burrs and prickles is amazed, amid so much that
is fair and cherishable, to come upon such curious barbarism.&nbsp;
An Englishman paid a visit of admiration to a professor in the Land
of Culture, and was introduced by him to another distinguished professor,
to whom he took so cordially as to walk out with him alone one afternoon.&nbsp;
The first professor, an erudite entirely worthy of the sentiment of
scholarly esteem prompting the visit, behaved (if we exclude the dagger)
with the vindictive jealousy of an injured Spanish beauty.&nbsp; After
a short prelude of gloom and obscure explosions, he discharged upon
his faithless admirer the bolts of passionate logic familiar to the
ears of flighty caballeros:&mdash;&lsquo;Either I am a fit object of
your admiration, or I am not.&nbsp; Of these things one&mdash;either
you are competent to judge, in which case I stand condemned by you;
or you are incompetent, and therefore impertinent, and you may betake
yourself to your country again, hypocrite!&rsquo;&nbsp; The admirer
was for persuading the wounded scholar that it is given to us to be
able to admire two professors at a time.&nbsp; He was driven forth.</p>
<p>Perhaps this might have occurred in any country, and a comedy of
The Pedant, discovering the greedy humanity within the dusty scholar,
would not bring it home to one in particular.&nbsp; I am mindful that
it was in Germany, when I observe that the Germans have gone through
no comic training to warn them of the sly, wise emanation eyeing them
from aloft, nor much of satirical.&nbsp; Heinrich Heine has not been
enough to cause them to smart and meditate.&nbsp; Nationally, as well
as individually, when they are excited they are in danger of the grotesque,
as when, for instance, they decline to listen to evidence, and raise
a national outcry because one of German blood has been convicted of
crime in a foreign country.&nbsp; They are acute critics, yet they still
wield clubs in controversy.&nbsp; Compare them in this respect with
the people schooled in La Bruy&egrave;re, La Fontaine, Moli&egrave;re;
with the people who have the figures of a Trissotin and a Vadius before
them for a comic warning of the personal vanities of the caressed professor.&nbsp;
It is more than difference of race.&nbsp; It is the difference of traditions,
temper, and style, which comes of schooling.</p>
<p>The French controversialist is a polished swordsman, to be dreaded
in his graces and courtesies.&nbsp; The German is Orson, or the mob,
or a marching army, in defence of a good case or a bad&mdash;a big or
a little.&nbsp; His irony is a missile of terrific tonnage: sarcasm
he emits like a blast from a dragon&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; He must and
will be Titan.&nbsp; He stamps his foe underfoot, and is astonished
that the creature is not dead, but stinging; for, in truth, the Titan
is contending, by comparison, with a god.</p>
<p>When the Germans lie on their arms, looking across the Alsatian frontier
at the crowds of Frenchmen rushing to applaud L&rsquo;ami Fritz at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, looking and considering the meaning
of that applause, which is grimly comic in its political response to
the domestic moral of the play&mdash;when the Germans watch and are
silent, their force of character tells.&nbsp; They are kings in music,
we may say princes in poetry, good speculators in philosophy, and our
leaders in scholarship.&nbsp; That so gifted a race, possessed moreover
of the stern good sense which collects the waters of laughter to make
the wells, should show at a disadvantage, I hold for a proof, instructive
to us, that the discipline of the comic spirit is needful to their growth.&nbsp;
We see what they can reach to in that great figure of modern manhood,
Goethe.&nbsp; They are a growing people; they are conversable as well;
and when their men, as in France, and at intervals at Berlin tea-tables,
consent to talk on equal terms with their women, and to listen to them,
their growth will be accelerated and be shapelier.&nbsp; Comedy, or
in any form the Comic spirit, will then come to them to cut some figures
out of the block, show them the mirror, enliven and irradiate the social
intelligence.</p>
<p>Modern French comedy is commendable for the directness of the study
of actual life, as far as that, which is but the early step in such
a scholarship, can be of service in composing and colouring the picture.&nbsp;
A consequence of this crude, though well-meant, realism is the collision
of the writers in their scenes and incidents, and in their characters.&nbsp;
The Muse of most of them is an <i>Aventuri&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; She
is clever, and a certain diversion exists in the united scheme for confounding
her.&nbsp; The object of this person is to reinstate herself in the
decorous world; and either, having accomplished this purpose through
deceit, she has a <i>nostalgie de la boue</i>, that eventually casts
her back into it, or she is exposed in her course of deception when
she is about to gain her end.&nbsp; A very good, innocent young man
is her victim, or a very astute, goodish young man obstructs her path.&nbsp;
This latter is enabled to be the champion of the decorous world by knowing
the indecorous well.&nbsp; He has assisted in the progress of Aventuri&egrave;res
downward; he will not help them to ascend.&nbsp; The world is with him;
and certainly it is not much of an ascension they aspire to; but what
sort of a figure is he?&nbsp; The triumph of a candid realism is to
show him no hero.&nbsp; You are to admire him (for it must be supposed
that realism pretends to waken some admiration) as a credibly living
young man; no better, only a little firmer and shrewder, than the rest.&nbsp;
If, however, you think at all, after the curtain has fallen, you are
likely to think that the Aventuri&egrave;res have a case to plead against
him.&nbsp; True, and the author has not said anything to the contrary;
he has but painted from the life; he leaves his audience to the reflections
of unphilosophic minds upon life, from the specimen he has presented
in the bright and narrow circle of a spy-glass.</p>
<p>I do not know that the fly in amber is of any particular use, but
the Comic idea enclosed in a comedy makes it more generally perceptible
and portable, and that is an advantage.&nbsp; There is a benefit to
men in taking the lessons of Comedy in congregations, for it enlivens
the wits; and to writers it is beneficial, for they must have a clear
scheme, and even if they have no idea to present, they must prove that
they have made the public sit to them before the sitting to see the
picture.&nbsp; And writing for the stage would be a corrective of a
too-incrusted scholarly style, into which some great ones fall at times.&nbsp;
It keeps minor writers to a definite plan, and to English.&nbsp; Many
of them now swelling a plethoric market, in the composition of novels,
in pun-manufactories and in journalism; attached to the machinery forcing
perishable matter on a public that swallows voraciously and groans;
might, with encouragement, be attending to the study of art in literature.&nbsp;
Our critics appear to be fascinated by the quaintness of our public,
as the world is when our beast-garden has a new importation of magnitude,
and the creatures appetite is reverently consulted.&nbsp; They stipulate
for a writer&rsquo;s popularity before they will do much more than take
the position of umpires to record his failure or success.&nbsp; Now
the pig supplies the most popular of dishes, but it is not accounted
the most honoured of animals, unless it be by the cottager.&nbsp; Our
public might surely be led to try other, perhaps finer, meat.&nbsp;
It has good taste in song.&nbsp; It might be taught as justly, on the
whole, and the sooner when the cottager&rsquo;s view of the feast shall
cease to be the humble one of our literary critics, to extend this capacity
for delicate choosing in the direction of the matter arousing laughter.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
